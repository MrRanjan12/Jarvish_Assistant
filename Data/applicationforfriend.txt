Dear [Name],

I hope this letter finds you in excellent spirits. As we have known each other for quite some time now, I thought it would be a great idea to formalize our friendship by submitting an application for your consideration.

As you are well aware, our friendship has been built on a foundation of mutual trust, respect, and understanding. Over the years, we have shared countless memories, supported each other through thick and thin, and have been each other's rock in times of need.

I am writing to formally request that you accept my application to be your friend. I believe that our friendship has been one of the most valuable assets in my life, and I would like to continue nurturing and growing our relationship.

In my application, I would like to highlight the following qualifications and strengths:

* Unwavering support: I have always been there for you, no matter what challenges you have faced. I believe that a true friend should be able to offer a listening ear and a helping hand whenever needed.
* Trustworthiness: I have always been transparent and honest in my dealings with you, and I believe that trust is the foundation of any strong friendship.
* Sense of humor: I know that we have shared many laughs together, and I believe that a good sense of humor is essential in any friendship.
* Emotional intelligence: I have always been able to empathize with your feelings and understand your perspective, which I believe is an important quality in any friend.

In return, I would like to offer the following benefits to our friendship:

* Loyalty: I promise to stand by your side through all the ups and downs of life.
* Confidentiality: I will always respect your privacy and keep your secrets safe.

Here is a letter to your friend:

Dear [Friend's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in excellent spirits and good health. It's been far too long since we last caught up, and I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I hope this letter finds you well.

I've been doing well myself. Work has been keeping me busy, but I've been managing to find some time for my hobbies and interests. I've been trying to get out and explore more of the city, and I even took a weekend trip to the mountains recently. It was amazing! The scenery was breathtaking, and it was a great opportunity to unwind and recharge.

I've also been thinking about our conversation the last time we met. You were saying how you were looking to make some changes in your life, and I wanted to check in and see how things are going. Have you made any progress on those goals? I'm here for you, and I'd love to offer any support or guidance if you need it.

On a different note, I came across an article the other day that made me think of you. It was about [related topic], and I immediately thought of our conversation about [related topic]. I thought you might find it interesting, so I've attached it to this email. Let me know what you think!

Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and catch up. I've missed our conversations, and I'd love to hear about what's been going on in your life. Do you have any big plans or projects coming up? I want to hear all about it!

Take care, and talk to you soon.

Best regards,
Ranjan Kumar
